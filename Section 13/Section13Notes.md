# What is Kubernetes
- Popular container orchestrator 
- Container Orchestration is just making many nodes which are all alike 
- A set of APIs in containers 
- There are many options to use it 

# Why Kubernetes
- Not every solution requires a heavy usage of orchestration 
- Heroku is a great alternative of not doing your orchestration

# Kubernetes vs Swarm
- Both similar tools which solve same problems and run on top of the containers 
- Both are backed with great support
- Swarm is easier to get started not solving all of the use cases
- Kubernetes more support and wider use cases are solved
- Swarm comes with Docker and one single team and little resource consumption 
- Swarm is secure and easier to resolve problems 
- Kubernetes widest support of the cloud vendors
