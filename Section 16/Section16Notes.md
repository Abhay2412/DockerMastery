# Kubernetes Management Techniques
- Generators are like templates, are like specifications to apply to the cluster
- A lot of things occur in the background when running the run, create and expose commands 
- "--dry-run -o yaml": Can output these templates with this command and then use them for as a starting point for the YAML files
- Kubernetes Imperative we start with a state we know and no deployment exists 
- Different commands are needed to change the deployment and this easier when we know the state 
- Kubernetes Declarative don't know the current state, we only know what we want the end result to be 
- Imperative commands(best for learning): run, expose, scale, edit, create deployment 
- Imperative objects: create -f file.yml, replace -f file.yml, delete -f file.yml, this is good for small environments single file for each command
- Declarative objects: apply -f file.yml, this is for bigger environment, harder to understand but easier ot automate 
- Do not mix these three together
