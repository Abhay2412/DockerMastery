# Future of Kubernetes
- StatefulSets are different from deployments designed to run databases, helps with storages 
- Stateless is simple and which don't involve databases, for example use APIs for Frontend 
- With any Container you can add a volume, and can do so in the spec of the YAML file
- The volumes are tied to a lifecycle of a Pod
- PersistentVolumes: Defined outside of the pod at the cluster level, separate storage options from using Pod
- None of the Service types work on the HTTP layer 
- Ingress Controllers do this with 3rd part proxies 
- Not installed by default on Kubernetes 
- Can add 3rd party resources and controllers to Kubernetes 
- Operator pattern is using customizing code is being implemented with Kubernetes as if it was part of Kubernetes with get go from installation 
- All kubetcl commands talk to the API of Kubernetes 
- Helm is a tool which builds templates and comes out of the box and creates manifests 
- Use random high ports, or use a proxy authentication when using the Kubernetes Dashboard 
- Namespaces are virtual clusters and not only it filters the command
- Kubernetes namespaces allows you to create mini clusters 
- "kubectl get all --all-namespaces": All the APIs containers inside of Kubernetes
