# Automated CI Workflows
- CI/CD: Continuous integration and deployment part of testing and packaging 
- Getting automation close to where your code is for example in the repo
- Pull requests are industry practices now 
- GitHub was the first company to introduce Pull request(pulling code your changes into the main branch)
- Can automate everything with shell scripts, but GitHub Actions helps you with drag and drop of their plugin systems 
- Linting is critical to do and do this in parallel with building your Pull request
