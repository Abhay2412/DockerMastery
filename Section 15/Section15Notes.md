# Service Types
- "kubectl expose": Creates an endpoint for the existing pods also known as a service 
- Does not change the pods and creates an additional feature for the deployment
- Can add a --type to change from the default which is ClusterIP
- One set of Kubernetes pods to another set of them
- ClusterIP is default and always works only good in the cluster for the nodes and other pods 
- NodePort designed for outside of the cluster and each node is allocated a high port
- These two will be there in the Kubernetes
- LoadBalancer is a bunch of automation and creates a cluster IP and node port , and then talk to an external cloud service provide like AWS
- "kubectl get pods -w": A watch command to see what is happening with the pods, and keep running as things change over time
- "kubectl get service": The IP that is allocated 
- "kubectl delete service": To remove the services and deployment
